                  <p><h3>SULPHUR CRESTED COCKATOO</h3></p>
                  <p class="text-light">The largest cockatoos are greater sulfur-crested cockatoos. Sulfur-crested cockatoos grow to be 15 inches long.
                    Even though they are not as enormous as the other parrots, they are still among the largest.
                    Unless your sulfur-crested cockatoo is allowed out for long periods, large cages are essential for housing. 
                    This parrot needs to spread its wings without striking the sides of the cage.
                    Sulfur-crested cockatoos are usually friendly, but they require time to adjust to being handled.They do not get along with kids, especially those who want to stroke their pets.
                    
                    Length: 15 to 20 inches
                    Weight: 12 to 31 ounces
                    Wingspan: 40 inches
                    Lifespan: 20 to 40 years</p>

                <p><h3>LOVEBIRDS PARROT</h3></p>
               <p class="text-light">Lovebirds are petite and compact, with a length of 5 to 7 inches. They are also 40 to 60 grams in weight. 
                Their personalities are friendly and curious, and they create deep pair relationships with other lovebirds and their owners.
                Lovebirds do not usually learn to communicate. But they like learning tricks and charming little entertainers in other ways.
                There is a common misconception about lovebirds that they must be kept in pairs for them to thrive. However, that is not always the case.
                The majority of Lovebird owners have discovered that solitary Lovebirds make better pets than pairs.
                It is because single birds form attachments and bonds with their owners rather than with other birds.
                
                Length: 5 to 7 inches
                Weight: 40 to 60 g
                Lifespan: 15 to 25 years </p>

                <p><h3>AFRICAN GREY PARROT</h3></p>
                <p class="text-light">They are one of the most well-known parrots on the planet.
                    To keep an African grey as a pet busy, attentive, and mentally challenged, you will need to provide plenty of toys and puzzles.
                    African greys are also easily stressed and require a peaceful environment to live in.
                    They prefer to have their cages against a wall where they may hide, and they enjoy roaming about in it.
                    These birds are also known for their advanced intelligence. But we will talk more about that later. 

                    Length: 9 to 14 inches
                    Weight: 11 to 19 ounce
                    Wingspan: 18 to 20 inches
                    Lifespan: 80 years in captivity</p>

                <p><h3>ECLECTUS PARROT</h3></p>
                <p class="text-light">These striking birds also deserve to be on this list, thanks to their massive size.
                    Eclectus parrots are sweet-natured, docile birds.
                    They are great with kids, but they do not enjoy a lot of noise.
                    They are also lively birds who require plenty of room in the cage to move about. 
                    These birds are generally pleasant and calm, but they need a caregiver who can keep them on a consistent daily schedule.
                    When they are trapped in a cage that is too small, they become restless and destructive.
                    
                    Length: 17 to 30 inches
                    Weight: 13 to 19 ounces
                    Wingspan: 8 to 10 inches
                    Lifespan: 30 years in captivity</p>
